[Verso 1]
We spent a hard day’s night watching movies slow,
I’d fall asleep, but with you I’d glow.
In your arms, I’m only sleeping felt so right,
Your peace was my shelter every night.

[Verso 2]
Dinners and laughter, things we said today,
Your family mine, in a warm embrace.
Month by month, I’d bring you something new,
Every little act of love was all for you.

[Coro]
But yesterday is all I see,
Here, there and everywhere you live in me.
I told your parents I’d stay true,
That all my loving belonged to you.

[Verso 3]
We’d come together in secret, fire and flame,
Two souls escaping, whispering each other’s name.
I dreamed of forever, a hand to hold,
But two days later, the story turned cold.

[Puente]
While my guitar gently weeps, I can’t pretend,
What we built with love had a bitter end.
A friend in disguise, with a little help from lies,
In just one moment, all hope dies.

[Coro final]
But yesterday is all I see,
Here, there and everywhere you live in me.
Though love is all you need was not enough,
Two days of pleasure broke our trust.

[Outro]
The long and winding road led us apart,
But I’ll remember the peace you gave my heart.
All those yesterdays, lost in time,
A love so deep… yet not truly mine.
