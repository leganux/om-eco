[Verso 1]
Imagine a world with no disguise,
No broken hearts, no hidden lies.
Imagine a place where truth is free,
And kindness flows like a melody.

[Verso 2]
Imagine no karma, no debts to pay,
Just souls in peace, finding their way.
Imagine no tears, no pain to mend,
Just open hearts that never pretend.

[Coro]
But don’t just dream, don’t only say,
You can build that world today.
No revenge, no chains of sorrow,
Just a brighter, truer tomorrow.

[Puente]
Through strawberry fields and golden skies,
The spirit grows, the ego dies.
With every song, the truth appears,
The path of love is crystal clear.

[Coro]
Don’t imagine — create it now,
The light within will show you how.
No more shadows, the pain is gone,
Your spirit sings, here comes the sun.

[Outro]
Thanks to the songs that lit the way,
That held my hand through night and day.
The Beatles taught my soul to see,
The road back home… to the real me.
