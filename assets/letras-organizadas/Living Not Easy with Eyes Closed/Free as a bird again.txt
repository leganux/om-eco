[Verso 1]
Photographs on the wall, gifts in a box,
Every place we knew, every ticking clock.
In the faces of friends, in the streets we knew,
The past keeps whispering, yesterday’s news.

[Pre-Coro]
But what they said was true, I see it clear,
That losing you was the start of my year.

[Coro]
Now I’m free as a bird, I can finally fly,
The pain was the fire, but it lit up the sky.
I gained more than I lost, I broke the chain,
Walking to the sun, through joy and pain.

[Verso 2]
Your shadow online, the words left behind,
At first they cut deep, but now I don’t mind.
It was a hard day’s night, but I made it through,
The cancer is gone, and the soul feels new.

[Pre-Coro]
The universe whispers, the spirit grows,
Through every wound, a garden shows.

[Coro]
Now I’m free as a bird, I can finally fly,
The pain was the fire, but it lit up the sky.
I gained more than I lost, I broke the chain,
Walking to the sun, through joy and pain.

[Puente]
From blackbird singing in the dead of night,
I’ve learned to take these broken wings, take flight.
No helter skelter, no hidden disguise,
Just a rising soul in the morning skies.

[Coro final]
Now I’m free as a bird, I can finally soar,
The universe open, I need nothing more.
The wound was deep, but I learned to heal,
And love for myself is the truest real.

[Outro]
I walk toward the light, where the stars align,
A spirit reborn, and the sun is mine.
