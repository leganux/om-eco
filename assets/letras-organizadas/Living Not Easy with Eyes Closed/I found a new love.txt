[Verso 1]
We walk down Penny Lane, holding hands so tight,
Laughing in the sun, dancing through the night.
At the café, with a smile so true,
I say something in the way she moves.

[Verso 2]
We ride the train, day tripper style,
Every little moment makes me smile.
All you need is love — they sing above,
And I found it here, in a brand new love.
(one day you look, I was the one, but tomorrow may rain I follow the sun)
[Coro]
Yes, I found love, can’t you see?
She’s everywhere, surrounding me.
Not just one, but more than two—
My friends, my family, and myself too.

[Puente]
No nowhere man, no lonely tune,
I’ve built a world where hearts commune.
And when they ask who holds my hand,
I smile and say: this is my band.

(one day you look, I was the one, but tomorrow may rain I follow the sun)

[Coro]
Yes, I found love, and it feels so right,
Not a fleeting game in the dead of night.
It’s in my soul, it’s all around,
In my life, true love is found.

[Outro]
And the secret is clear, if you understand,
The love I found… was in my own hand.
(love, love, love, all you need is love)
(love, love, love, all you need is love)
