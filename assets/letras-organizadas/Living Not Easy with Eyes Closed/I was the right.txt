[Verso 1]
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed to stay,
But you whispered “Girl, you’ll never know the way.”
I gave my love, like a fool on the hill,
Two days later, your heart had someone to fill.

[Coro]
And in my life, I still love you more,
But there’s no reply when I knock on your door.
Though tomorrow may rain, I’ll follow the sun,
For no one can break what I’ve become.

[Verso 2]
You said “I love you” with a smile so wide,
But baby’s in black was the truth you hide.
You and my friend, like a twist and shout,
While my guitar gently wept it out.

[Coro]
And in my life, I still love you more,
But there’s no reply when I knock on your door.
Though tomorrow may rain, I’ll follow the sun,
For no one can break what I’ve become.

[Puente]
Yes it is, I was broken, torn apart,
But now I’ve built a brand new heart.
I’m a loser, not this time,
Now I’m stronger, and the light is mine.

[Verso 3]
Zul, go to him, that’s where you belong,
I’ll be back in spirit, through another song.
Things we said today still haunt the air,
But she’s leaving home, and I don’t care.

(One day you'll find, I was the right,
but tomorrow may rain, so, I follow the sun.)

(Here comes the sun, here comes the sun...)
(Here comes the sun, here comes the sun...)

[Outro]
Oh darling, don’t you see?
Love’s not the same, but it set me free.
Yesterday’s gone, and the pain undone,
Though tomorrow will rain, I’ll follow the sun.
