[Verso 1]
You say “come together” like it’s yesterday,
But love’s not a game of fool on the hill play.
It’s been a long and winding road since then,
And I won’t be fooled by words of love again.

[Coro]
If you want me back, it takes a revolution,
Not illusions, but real solutions.
All you need is love won’t be enough this time,
I need a fixing a hole in this heart of mine.

[Verso 2]
I gave you all my loving, eight days a week,
But you chose a secret ticket to ride so cheap.
Now if you say don’t let me down once more,
Show me something real I’ve never seen before.

[Coro]
If you want me back, it takes a revolution,
Carry that weight and build restitution.
No more hello goodbye with a plastic smile,
In my life I need the truth worthwhile.

[Puente]
This is a day in the life, no magical mystery tour,
No strawberry fields forever can make me sure.
We can work it out, but only if you try,
Not a second time with another lie.

[Verso 3]
Don’t whisper I want to hold your hand,
Show me the work, help me understand.
Turn the blackbird night into morning light,
Prove that love you make can still be right.

[Coro final]
If you want me back, it takes a revolution,
A living, breathing, true contribution.
All things must pass, and so must pain,
But only actions bring the sun through rain.

[Outro]
So if you come, let it be with grace,
Let it be written in every trace.
In the end, the love you save must grow—
That’s the only way I’ll ever know.
