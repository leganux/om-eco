[Verso 1]
I carried you in my heart, working night and day,
Dreaming of a home, children laughing someday.
Hand in hand, I thought we’d never part,
Building our tomorrow, stone by stone, heart to heart.

(Ah, girl
Girl, girl
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there you feel a fool)

[Pre-Coro]
But love can blind, and love can break,
A cruel twist no soul should take.

(He blew his mind out in a car... He didn't notice that she has gone)

[Coro]
Now shadows in the sun, tearing me apart,
The words I read cut deep into my heart.
You called him “love” while I was the one,
Yesterday is gone, but the wound lives on.

[Verso 2]
A secret game, the lies you tried to hide,
I asked for truth, you still denied.
Until the day the mask fell down,
And every hope I had was drowned.

(Happiness is a warm gun, shot shot. )
(Happiness is a warm gun, shot shot. )
(Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is )
[Pre-Coro]
Promises fade, the echoes remain,
Your sweet “I love you” now whispers in vain.

[Coro]
Now shadows in the sun, tearing me apart,
The words I read cut deep into my heart.
You called him “love” while I was the one,
Yesterday is gone, but the wound lives on.

(Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see...)

[Puente]
Karma’s a song you already know,
What we give away will always grow.
And though you broke me, though I bled,
I still wish you peace on the road ahead.

[Coro]
Shadows in the sun, memories that sting,
But I’ll follow the light where tomorrow will sing.
I’ll carry the scar, though the battle’s done,
For the love I gave, you’ll always be someone.

(I'm a looser, I'm a looser. But I want you.)


[Outro]
Yesterday is gone…
But the wound lives on.
(She's so heaven. Heaven, heaven.)
