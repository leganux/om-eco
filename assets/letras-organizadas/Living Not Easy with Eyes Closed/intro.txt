“This is not just a collection of songs,
but a journey through shadows and light.
A story of love once cherished,
of betrayal that cut deep,
and of wounds that became the seeds of rebirth.

Through every step, the songs of four voices from Liverpool
were there to guide me.
They taught me how to face heartbreak with truth,
how to turn sorrow into melody,
and how to find peace in the simple beauty of life.

Each track carries echoes of their spirit—
hidden lines, familiar titles, gentle homages.
If you listen closely, you will find
the fingerprints of the Beatles woven into my story,
like companions walking beside me
on a long and winding road.

This album is about loss,
but more than that, it is about transformation.
It is about breaking the chains of sorrow,
walking toward the sun,
and realizing that love still lives—
within ourselves, within the bonds of family and friends,
and within the infinite universe that holds us all.

So listen carefully…
for these songs are both farewell and beginning.
A revolution in my life.
A rebirth of the soul.
And above all—
a hymn of gratitude to the four who showed me the way.”
