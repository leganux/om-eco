[Intro]
Open your eyes and take in everything that you see
Look at all the colors, red, yellow, blue, & green
[Verse 1]
We can take an airplane and fly across the globe
Look down upon the colors, everyone come on, let’s go
Because
[Chorus]
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
[Verse 2]
Open your ears and listen what the world has to say
Hear the birds & bells and you will have a brighter day
Everyone has a special song deep inside their heart
If you want, you could sing with us, it’s the perfect place to start
[Chorus]
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
[Verse 3]
Let’s take a moment and dance beneath the starry skies
Feel the rhythm of the earth, it’s where true magic lies
Kindness is contagious, so let’s spread it far and wide
A simple smile can spark a fire that never dies
[Bridge]
You can’t hurt me with the things that you do
I’ll pick up dandelions and I’ll give them to you
Puppy dogs, kitty cats swimming through love
[Chorus]
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
[Outro]
So open your heart and let the light shine through
Love is everywhere, and it starts with me and you
Love, love, love, la la love
La la love makes the world go ’round
